This repository contains Python code to control a robot using ROS (Robot Operating System) and MoveIt!. The code provided here is designed to move the end effector of the robot to different positions using Cartesian and quaternion trajectories.

## Code Description

The `tutorial.py` file contains the main code for controlling the robot. Here's a brief description of some key parts of the code:

- **Initialization**: ROS node is initialized and an instance of the `Tutorial1` class is created, which contains the main logic for controlling the robot.

- **Environment Setup**: Necessary Moveit! components are initialized and initial parameters of the robot and planning environment are configured.

- **Movement Methods**: Various methods are defined to move the robot's end effector to specific positions. These methods utilize both Cartesian and quaternion trajectories to generate movement paths.

- **Plan Execution**: Planned movements are executed using the methods defined earlier.

## Specific Command

The command `self.quaternions_paths(0,0,0)` is used to move the robot's end effector to a specific position in space. Here's an explanation of the parameters:

- `x`: Displacement along the x-axis (meters).
- `y`: Displacement along the y-axis (meters).
- `z`: Displacement along the z-axis (meters).
- `set_velocity`: Velocity scale factor of the movement (from 0 to 1).

In this particular case, the command moves the robot's end effector to a position that is displaced -0.2 meters along the x-axis, 0 meters along the y-axis, and -0.2 meters along the z-axis, with maximum velocity (velocity scale factor equal to 1).

## Requirements

- Python 3
- ROS (Robot Operating System)
- MoveIt!
- `rospy`
- `moveit_commander`
- `moveit_msgs`
- `geometry_msgs`
- `numpy`

## Usage

1. Start ROS in your environment:

```
roscore
```

2. Run the ROS node to control the robot:

```
rosrun package_name tutorial.py
```
